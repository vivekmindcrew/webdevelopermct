            Welcome to the Single Search Tab! This is where you can do individual searches by using the Last Name,
             Mailing Address and/or Phone Number/Email Address.

            Searching with just the Mailing Address will still provide a result, but since we are tracking the individual,
            you will get a higher accuracy ratio if you include the name.
